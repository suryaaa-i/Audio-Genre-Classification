Audio Genre Classification
Project Overview
This project aims to classify music tracks into their respective genres based on audio features. By utilizing a dataset with features such as tempo, energy, danceability, and other musical attributes, the project seeks to build a robust and generalizable classification model that accurately predicts the genre of a given track.

Problem Statement
Music genre classification is essential for various applications, such as music recommendation systems, digital music organization, and streaming platform personalization. However, genres can often overlap in their features, making accurate classification challenging. This project addresses the challenge by using machine learning to classify songs based on track attributes.

Objective: Develop a machine learning model that can classify music tracks into distinct genres, utilizing track-level attributes as predictive features. The model's accuracy and interpretability are key, ensuring it performs well on unseen data and provides insights into the feature contributions to each genre.

Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values and standardize the format of categorical variables.
Convert categorical columns (e.g., Explicit) into numerical formats suitable for model processing.
Encode the target variable (Genre) using label encoding to facilitate classification.
Feature Selection:

Analyze features to identify the most relevant predictors of genre.
Employ feature importance techniques to assess each feature's contribution to the model.
Model Training:

Use a supervised learning model, specifically a Random Forest classifier, known for its robustness in handling mixed feature types and high-dimensional data.
Train the model using a portion of the data while reserving a subset for testing.
Evaluation and Robustness:

Implement cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance across multiple data splits, ensuring generalization to new data.
Perform sensitivity analysis to explore the model's reliance on individual features, providing insights into feature contributions.
Interpretability:

Utilize SHAP values to enhance model interpretability by displaying the impact of each feature on individual predictions.
Generate a summary of SHAP values to visualize feature importance, making the model's behavior more understandable for users and stakeholders.
Key Evaluation Metrics
Cross-Validation Performance: The model's robustness is evaluated using cross-validation scores, which provide insights into its performance on different subsets of the data.
AUC-ROC: Used for measuring the model's ability to distinguish between genres, especially useful for multi-class classification.
Confusion Matrix: Shows the distribution of true vs. predicted classes, highlighting any potential class imbalance issues.
Feature Importance: Analyzes the relevance of each feature to the model's predictions, aiding in interpretability and potential feature refinement.
Results and Insights
By using cross-validation and sensitivity analysis, the model's robustness and generalizability were validated. SHAP values allowed for an in-depth understanding of feature contributions, highlighting which attributes were most influential in determining genre classifications. The model's predictions, supported by key features, provide valuable insights for practical applications like playlist generation, music discovery, and recommendation systems.

Usage
Place the dataset (e.g., tracks_data.csv) in the appropriate directory.
Run the script or Jupyter notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and visualize the evaluation metrics.
Interpret the modelâ€™s predictions and SHAP values to understand how each feature influences genre classification.
Future Work
Feature Engineering: Explore additional audio features or external metadata to improve model accuracy.
Advanced Models: Experiment with deep learning models for potentially better performance on large-scale audio datasets.
User Personalization: Extend this project to provide personalized recommendations based on genre preferences.
